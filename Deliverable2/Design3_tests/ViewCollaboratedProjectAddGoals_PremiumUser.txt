User Story: 
	As a Collaborated user, I want to be able to View the hobby project so that I can add targets/goals and track progress over time in it.


Scenario: 
	User sees the collaborated Project in Hobby page
        Given that User is already logged in the user should see all the features
        The user should be able to see the collaborated project on their "project" and add goals


Test Design: 
        Log in as User and view the "Hobby" page
        Click on Collaborated Hobby Project "e.g. Learn Guitar"
	To add goals click on a  "Add Goal"
        Fill in the "Description" field with "Learn the node base"
	Click on the "Create Goal" button


Outcome:
       The user collaborated with should see The new hobby appear on "Hobby" page with the correct details and add goals to it as well
