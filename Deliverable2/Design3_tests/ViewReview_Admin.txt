Feature: Admin Viewing Feedback on Challenges

User Story: 
	As a Admin, I want to view all challenges and see feedback improve/ motivate other users on their leisure activities or take ideas for next challenge.


Scenario: Users(Standard+ Premium) give feedback on certain challenge
    Given the Admin is logged in
    They should be able to view the projects reviews left by the user


Test Design:
	Log in as Admin and go to Challenge Reviews page
        The reviews and the challenge the review is on will be displayed on the screen


Outcome: 
	The admin should be able to view review of all challenges
