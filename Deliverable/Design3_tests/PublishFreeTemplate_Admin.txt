Scenario: Admin creates a new wellness template
    Given the Reviewer is logged in
    When they create a new template titled "7-Day Relaxation Plan"
    Then the template "7-Day Relaxation Plan" should be saved in the system

    Given the Reviewer has created the template "7-Day Relaxation Plan"
