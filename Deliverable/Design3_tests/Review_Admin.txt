Feature: Admin Viewing and Providing Feedback on Public Leisure Projects

User Story: As a Admin, I want to view all public leisure projects and leave feedback or tips to motivate other users and help them improve their projects.


Scenario: Reviewer views a public leisure project
    Given the Reviewer is logged in
    When they browse the list of public leisure projects
    Then they should be able to see all available public projects

Scenario: Reviewer leaves feedback on a public leisure project
    Given the Reviewer is viewing the public project "Reading Challenge"
    When they leave feedback "Great task list! Maybe add a meditation session."
    Then the feedback "Great task list! Maybe add a meditation session." should be displayed under the project

	Log in as Admin and go to "Hobby page"
        Browse the list of public leisure projects
	The Reviewer is views the public project "Learn Guittare"
	Click on "Feedback" Button
    	Leave feedback "Great task list! Maybe add a electric guittare session."
